                This image was from my first proper research experience.
                My group decided to investigate the effects of allochthonous carbon inputs on freshwater macroinvertebrate community composition, and we found that macroinvertebrate population density had a positive correlation with sunken leaf litter biomass, but we did not find any significant difference in composition of specific functional feeding groups, which is what we had hoped to find.

                We browsed project ideas with a class, then split off into two groups, each with 3-4 members.
                In my group, we came up with the project from scratch; we browsed potential research questions, methodology, nearby locations we could access to collect stream samples, catalogued our samples, analyzed them and drew conclusions, and finally presented our findings to the class.

                I also had the opportunity to practice writing NSF grant proposals.
                My first one was written as a solo assignment as part of my Ecosystems Ecology class, while the other was written as a group project as part of my Ecomechanics Seminar.
                In my first practice proposal, I wanted to investigate the effects of plant biodiversity and functional trait diversity affect carbon storage in tropical forest ecosystems.
                My second practice proposal investigated the effects of air pollution on different types of avian species, specifically the differences in how high- and low-altitude species are affected.

                Writing the first practice proposal was one of the most challenging assignments I have ever had at Carleton, and it gave me a taste of the difficulties of applying for research funding in the real world.
                Despite it being a group project, the second practice proposal was still challenging, even when taking into consideration the fact that I had already written one before.
                These two practice proposals, however, are the first real steps that I have taken into preparing myself for the real world.
