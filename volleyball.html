            <p>
                I first began playing volleyball in middle school.
                Initially, I hated the sport; to this day, I am unsure why I continued with it for the first couple of years.
                My coach and teammates treated me poorly, and I had to figure out how to play properly by myself, with little to no guidance.
                After I moved to Singapore, however, I decided to approach the sport differently.

                I began to play less for myself, and more for the team.
                In doing so, I discovered my passion for the sport, and also began improving at a much faster pace.
                Over the years, volleyball has become far more than just a form of exercise and fun.
                It has taught me not only the importance of teamwork and cooperativeness, but also when to step up and take charge, and when to step back and let others provide their own input.
